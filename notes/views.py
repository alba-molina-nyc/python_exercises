"""
Question “index” page – displays the latest few questions.
Question “detail” page – displays a question text, with no results but with a form to vote.
Question “results” page – displays results for a particular question.
Vote action – handles voting for a particular choice in a particular question.

Take a look in your browser, at “/polls/34/”. It’ll run the detail() method

and display whatever ID you provide in the URL. Try “/polls/34/results/” and “/polls/34/vote/” too – these will display the placeholder results and voting pages.

When somebody requests a page from your website – say, “/polls/34/”, Django will load the mysite.urls Python module because it’s pointed to by the ROOT_URLCONF setting. It finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the patterns in order. After finding the match at 'polls/', it strips off the matching text ("polls/") and sends the remaining text – "34/" – to the ‘polls.urls’ URLconf for further processing. There it matches '<int:question_id>/', resulting in a call to the detail() view like so:

detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id=34)
Save
The question_id=34 part comes from <int:question_id>. Using angle brackets “captures” part of the URL and sends it as a keyword argument to the view function. The question_id part of the string defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern, and the int part is a converter that determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path. The colon (:) separates the converter and pattern name."""
